## Introduction

This portfolio represents my coding journey, highlighting various projects I've developed using Laravel/PHP. My primary goal was to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly platform that not only showcases my skills but also demonstrates my dedication to writing clean, efficient code.

## Features

- **Project Display:** The portfolio prominently features a collection of my Laravel/PHP projects. Each project card offers a concise overview and directs visitors to the respective project repositories or live demos.

- **LinkedIn API Integration (Coming Soon):** The portfolio is in the process of integrating the LinkedIn API. This integration will dynamically fetch and display my LinkedIn profile information, including current employment, education, and profile picture.

- **Firebase Database (Coming Soon):** I'm working on integrating Firebase as the backend database for storing and managing project data. This will allow for easy updates to project information without modifying the codebase.

- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio has been meticulously designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across various screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

The portfolio has been built using the following technologies:

- **React.js:** The foundation of the portfolio's frontend, enabling the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Utilized for styling and layout, Tailwind CSS enables a highly customizable design approach.

- **GitHub Pages:** The portfolio has been deployed using GitHub Pages, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

## Future Plans

As I continue to refine and expand my portfolio, I have several exciting enhancements in mind:
